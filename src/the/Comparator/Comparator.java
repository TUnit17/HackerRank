 * PROBLEM STATEMENT
 * ----------------
 * Comparators are used to compare two objects
 * Create a comparator and use it to sort an array
 * The Player class has two fields : 
 * 		string name
 * 		integer score  
 * 
 * Given an array of n Player objects, write a comparator that sorts then in order of decreasing score
 * If two or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically by name 
 * 
 * Create a Checker class that implements the Comparator interface 
 * then write : int compare(Player a, Player b) 
 *

 * 
 * FAQ
 * ------
 * 
 * 1) What is the Comparator interface? 
 * 
 * 
 * 1.1) What methods must I define in the Comparator interface?
 * int compare(T o1, T o2) 
 * boolean equals(Object obj) 
 * 
 * 1.2) 
 * 
 * 
 * 2) What is an interface?
 * A group of methods with empty bodies that you must define 
 * 
 * 
 * 2.1) Is an interface called by implements?
 * YES
 * 
 * 2.2) Does an interface contain methods that I must implement/define
 * YES
 * 
 * 3) How do I use an interface?
 * implements 
 * 
 * 4) How do I compare my two objects?
 * 
 * 5) How do I define how to compare my two objects? 
 * 
 * 6) How do I define the rules that describe which
